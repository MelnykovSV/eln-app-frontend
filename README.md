# Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN)

## Overview

Welcome to the Electronic Laboratory Notebook (ELN), a powerful online tool designed to streamline your chemical synthesis projects. This web application is a comprehensive solution for chemists and researchers to efficiently plan, track, and manage their synthesis workflows. Whether you are a seasoned chemist or a novice in the field, ELN simplifies the entire process, from scheme creation to detailed stage management.

## Key Features

### Scheme Previews

- Get a quick snapshot of your synthesis projects with essential information, including starting compound, final product, number of stages, creation date, last update date, mass, and price.
- Sort and arrange your schemes based on creation date, last update date, mass, and price for efficient data management.

### Pagination

- Easily manage extensive lists of schemes with a convenient pagination system.

### SMILES Search

- Accelerate your research by searching for specific schemes using SMILES substrings, saving you time and effort in finding the relevant data.

### New Synthesis Page

- Initiate your synthesis project effortlessly through a user-friendly "New Scheme" form, where you can input all necessary data for your scheme.
- Break down the synthesis process into stages, allowing you to focus on specific details for each stage and maintain an overview of the entire scheme.
- Enter crucial data, including reaction conditions, solvent, yield, time, temperature, and methodic, for each stage.
- Real-time "Scheme Preview" updates provide an immediate overview of your project's progress and details as you enter information.

### Single Scheme Page

- Seamlessly navigate between different stages of your synthesis, enabling easy tracking of progress and input of essential data.
- Identify the last successfully completed stage outlined in green for quick progress tracking.
- Access a dedicated "Reagents Calculation" tab to obtain information about required reagents and calculate the masses needed to achieve the desired compound mass when yields are provided for each stage.

### Single Stage Page

- Switch between different experiments for a single stage with a simple select feature, essential for optimizing conditions and selecting the best approach.
- Input experiment conditions easily and accurately within each experiment tab, ensuring reproducible results.
- Automatic experiment yield calculations based on product mass and purity, saving time and eliminating manual calculations.
- Manage up to four reagents per experiment with automatic mass calculations based on starting material mass and reagent equivalents.
- Utilize the experiment spectra panel for dynamic management of experiment data, including PDF spectra uploads, comments, viewing, downloading, and deletion as needed.
